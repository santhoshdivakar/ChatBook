We should store the following. 

- Rooms List
-- Do we store the rooms even after they expire
-- How do we store permanent rooms v/s temporary rooms ( two seperate tables or expiry time? )
--- I think expiry time?. and then removal from the table... also means we would have to store
-- Rooms can have id's ?... or does the name become the id?.
--- I think rooms better have Id's, in case of old rooms having the same name 
- Which all users in the particular room
- a 2/5 min window of what happened in that room.
- a full-storage of the roomchat? ( do we need this? )
- user-name/ip-address/time-stamp/other-details mapping?
