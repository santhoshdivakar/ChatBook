We should store the following. 

- Rooms List
-- Do we store the rooms even after they expire
-- How do we store permanent rooms v/s temporary rooms ( two seperate tables or expiry time? )
--- I think expiry time?. and then removal from the table... also means we would have to store
--- We can make a list of current tables in SQL DB. 
---- The name of the table is rooms. 
---- The schema would be roomId, categoryName, roomName, permanent(Y/N), creationTime
--- We will make an outgoing table for capturing old tables
----This table would be called archive-rooms
----This table schema would be roomId, categoryName, roomName, creationTime,expiryTime 
----
- Which all users in the particular room
-- I think simple structure is good enough here
-- The table name is roomUsers ( hahaha , so creative )
-- Schema -roomId, userIdList ( how are we going to represent this, can we do this in SQL or DataStore? )
--
- a 2/5 min window of what happened in that room.
- a full-storage of the roomchat? ( do we need this? )
- user-name/ip-address/time-stamp/other-details mapping? 
-- Table of active users named "users"
--- Schema would be userId, userName, ipAddress, creationTime
-- Table to contain the archive of users - ArchiveUsers
--- Schema : userId, userName, ipAddress, creationTime, lastActiveTime
